# ckRGB Contribution Guidelines
First off, thank you for considering contributing to ckRGB! It's people like you that make the community better.

>Following these guidelines helps to communicate that you respect the time of the developers managing and developing this open source project. In return, they should reciprocate that respect in addressing your issue, assessing changes, and helping you finalize your pull requests.

### What we are looking for
Given the infancy of this project and room for growth, we are looking for contributors to write tutorials on Lua scripting, improving the documentation, submitting bug reports, adding feature requests, or writing code to improve the project.

### Ground Rules
This includes not just how to communicate with others (being respectful, considerate, etc) but also technical responsibilities (importance of testing, project dependencies, etc). Mention and link to your code of conduct, if you have one.

> Responsibilities
> * Ensure cross-platform compatibility for every change that's accepted. Windows, Mac, Debian & Ubuntu Linux.
> * Ensure that code that goes into core meets style guidelines defined here: https://github.com/Chaotic-Cody/ckRGB/blob/master/docs/Style%20Guidelines.md
> * Create issues for any major changes and enhancements that you wish to make. Discuss things transparently and get community feedback.
> * Don't add any classes to the codebase unless absolutely needed. Err on the side of using functions.
> * Keep feature versions as small as possible, preferably one new feature per version.
> * Be welcoming to newcomers and encourage diverse new contributors from all backgrounds.

### Your First Contribution
> Unsure where to begin contributing to ckRGB? You can start by looking through the milestones and progress in the README: https://github.com/Chaotic-Cody/ckRGB/blob/master/README.md

Here are a couple of friendly tutorials you can include: http://makeapullrequest.com/ and http://www.firsttimersonly.com/

> Working on your first Pull Request? You can learn how from this *free* series, [How to Contribute to an Open Source Project on GitHub](https://egghead.io/series/how-to-contribute-to-an-open-source-project-on-github).

### Submitting a Contribution
#### Large Contributions
>For something that is bigger than a one or two line fix:

>1. Create your own fork of the code
>2. Do the changes in your fork
>3. If you like the change and think the project could use it:
    * Be sure you have followed the code style for the project.
    * Sign the Contributor License Agreement, CLA, with the jQuery Foundation.
    * Note the jQuery Foundation Code of Conduct.
    * Send a pull request indicating that you have a CLA on file.

#### Small Contributions
> Small contributions such as fixing spelling errors, where the content is small enough to not be considered intellectual property, can be submitted by a contributor as a patch.

>As a rule of thumb, changes are obvious fixes if they do not introduce any new functionality or creative thinking. As long as the change does not affect functionality, some likely examples include the following:
>* Spelling / grammar fixes
>* Typo correction, white space and formatting changes
>* Comment clean up
>* Bug fixes that change default return values or error codes stored in constants
>* Adding logging messages or debugging output
>* Changes to ‘metadata’ files like Gemfile, .gitignore, build scripts, etc.
>* Moving source files from one directory or package to another
